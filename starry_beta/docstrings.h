    namespace Map {

        const char* doc = R"pbdoc(
            Instantiate a :py:mod:`starry_beta` surface map. The map is described
            as an expansion in spherical harmonics, with optional arbitrary
            order limb darkening. Users can set the spherical harmonic
            coefficients by direct assignment to the :py:obj:`l, m` index of
            the map instance. If :py:obj:`map` is an instance of this class,

            .. code-block:: python

                map[1, 0] = 0.5

            sets the coefficient of the :math:`Y_{1,0}` harmonic to
            :math:`\frac{1}{2}`. Users can set limb darkening coefficients
            by direct assignment to the :py:obj:`l` index of the map:

            .. code-block:: python

                map[1] = 0.4

            sets the first order limb darkening coefficient :math:`u_1` to
            :math:`0.4`.

            .. note:: Map instances are normalized such that the
                **average disk-integrated intensity is equal to the coefficient
                of the** :math:`Y_{0,0}` **term**, which defaults to unity. The
                total luminosity over all :math:`4\pi` steradians is therefore
                four times the :math:`Y_{0,0}` coefficient. This normalization
                is particularly convenient for constant or purely limb-darkened
                maps, whose disk-integrated intensity is always equal to unity.

            .. warning:: Note that the total degree of the map can never
                exceed :py:obj:`lmax`. For example, if :py:obj:`lmax=5` and
                you set spherical harmonic coefficients up to :py:obj:`lmax=3`,
                you may only set limb darkening coefficients up to second
                order.

            As of version 0.2.1, :py:obj:`starry_beta` supports multi-wavelength
            maps via the :py:obj:`nwav` keyword argument. If this argument is set
            to a value greater than one, light curves will be computed for each
            wavelength bin of the map. All coefficients at a given value of
            :py:obj:`l, m` and all limb darkening coefficients at a given value
            of :py:obj:`l` are now *vectors*, with one value per wavelength
            bin. Functions like :py:meth:`flux()` and :py:meth:`__call__()` will
            return one value per wavelength bin, and gradients will be
            computed at every wavelength. Note that this feature is still
            **experimental**, so please raise an issue on GitHub if you run
            into any trouble.

            Args:
                lmax (int): Largest spherical harmonic degree \
                    in the surface map. Default 2.

                multi (bool): Use multi-precision to perform all \
                    calculations? Default :py:obj:`False`. If :py:obj:`True`, \
                    defaults to 32-digit (approximately 128-bit) floating \
                    point precision. This can be adjusted by changing the \
                    :py:obj:`STARRY_NMULTI` compiler macro.

            Add the spherical harmonic expansion of a gaussian to the current

            by computing the spherical harmonic expansion of a 3D gaussian
            constrained to the surface of the sphere. This is useful for, say,
            modeling star spots or other discrete, localized features on a
            body's surface.

            .. note:: Because this routine wraps a Python function,
                      it is **slow** and should probably not be used repeatedly
                      when fitting a map to data!

            .. warning:: This routine is still in beta and may change in the
                         near future.

            Computes the total flux received by the observer
            during or outside of an occultation.

            Args:
                theta (float or ndarray): Angle of rotation. Default 0.
                xo (float or ndarray): The :py:obj:`x` position of the \

                If :py:obj:`gradient` is :py:obj:`True`, \

            Rotate the base map an angle :py:obj:`theta` about :py:obj:`axis`.
            This performs a permanent rotation to the base map. Subsequent

            rotational state.

            Check whether the map is positive semi-definite (PSD).
            Returns :py:obj:`True` if the map is PSD, :py:obj:`False` otherwise.
            For pure limb-darkened maps, this routine uses Sturm's theorem to
            find the number of roots; in addition, it checks whether the map
            is monotonically decreasing toward the limb by using Sturm's
            theorem on the *derivative* of the intensity profile.
            For pure spherical harmonic maps up to
            :py:obj:`l = 1`, the solution is analytic. For all
            other cases, this routine attempts to find the global minimum
            numerically and checks if it is negative. For maps with
            :py:obj:`nwav > 1`, this routine returns an array of boolean values,
            one per wavelength bin.

            Args:

            .. note:: Depending on the properties of a body's map, not all map
                coefficient gradients may be computed. For instance, for purely
                limb-darkened maps (whose :math:`Y_{l,m}` coefficients are zero
                for :math:`l > 1`), the derivatives of the flux with respect
                to the spherical harmonic coefficients are **not computed**.
                This is entirely in the interest of speed. To force the code
                to compute these, set one of the spherical harmonic coefficients
                to a very small (i.e., :math:`10^{-15}`) value. A similar
                caveat applies to maps with *no* limb-darkening, for which the
                derivatives with respect to the limb darkening coefficients are
                not computed by default.

            light is effectively infinite and there is no time delay. When this
            parameter is set, the time delay is computed with a second-order
            Taylor expansion, which should be accurate enough for most
            applications. Note that the reference point for the time delay
            (where :math:`\Delta t = 0`) is the barycenter of the system.
            Transits of bodies across the primary will therefore occur
            **earlier**, while occultations will occur **later**, than
            if there were no delay.

            Instantiate a secondary body. This body is assumed to be massless
            and orbits the primary in a pure Keplerian orbit. This class

            .. note:: When specifying the map coefficients of a
                :py:class:`Secondary` body, we need to be careful about the
                **frame** in which the map is defined. :py:obj:`starry_beta` was
                developed with exoplanet secondary eclipses in mind, so the map
                coefficients correspond to the map that would be visible at
                **opposition**, i.e., at "secondary eclipse" for an exoplanet
                in an edge-on orbit. For bodies in inclined/rotated orbits,
                the map coefficients correspond to the map that would be visible
                to an observer located down the :math:`z` axis, along the plane of the
                orbit. This means the **map coefficients are independent of the
                inclination or longitude of ascending node of the orbit.**
